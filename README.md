## An Ordinary Day 

**üî≠ To many, it might have seemed like just another ordinary day**  
***There I was, seated on my *b‚ô£tt*, kicking off one of my VBA projects.***

## Unexpected Adventures
<div align="right">
üöΩ Nature called, but alas, the restroom near my workstation was occupied.   </div>
<div align="right"> I found myself obliged to trek to another, located </div> <div align="right"> far across the production hall from my current spot.  </div>
<div align="right">  Nevertheless, it turned out to be the best decision I made all day.</div>

## Embracing Challenges
<div align="left">üëØ Many individuals clamored for newer projects, </div>
<div align="left">while I, functioning as "Quality Assurance" without QA responsibilities, </div>
<div align="left">cause worked as VBA dev, how not weird - found myself entrenched in VBA tasks. </div>
<div align="left">It was a paradoxical situation, being stationed at the QA Department but deeply </div>
<div align="left">engrossed in automating analysis generation.</div>

## Mysterious Encounters
<div align="right">You may find this hard to believe, </div>
  <div align="right">but following that seemingly mundane day came another, </div>
    <div align="right">equally eventful enough to earn the title of 'that only once' day.</div>

<div align="right">Amidst my trek to the alternate restroom, a </div>
  <div align="right">fleeting moment transpired as I passed by the smoking room. </div>
  <div align="right">From within, a voice called out,"Hey,you!"</div>
<div align="right">"Hey, I've heard you're coding something. My programmer recently resigned... </div>
  <div align="right">would you care to join us?" I stand silent and couldn't understand what is happening. </div>
  <div align="right">Those were the first words I ever heard from this person, but I understand one thing at 100%. </div>
  
### ***It was impossible - to get more opportune moment to go to WC.***

## Evolving Expertise
üë®‚Äçüíª Without a shadow of doubt, I eagerly embraced the opportunity, not lured by the promise of hefty paychecks  
*(though it certainly exceeded my earnings in QA).*  

Immersed in the labyrinth of IT routines, I navigated adeptly  
through the realms of Java, VBA, and Android, even daring to  
dip my toes into the tumultuous waters of Ruby  
```
About decision with ruby - I rue. Ruby proved to be a formidable opponent,  
leaving me waving the white flag in defeat. As painful as that experience was,  
it taught me a valuable lesson. consistently, I no longer engage with Ruby.
```
Despite the relentless repetition inherent in these tasks, I unearthed a profound sense of fulfillment in my endeavors.

## Current Skills
### Java
<div align="center">
My undisputed queen and the tool that never fails to captivate me. Primarily, I immerse myself in the realm of modern Java, particularly focusing on web applications‚Äîwhether it's backend development, crafting scheduled console applications with web access to dynamically changing configurations, or delving into microservices and cloud architecture. In 90% of my projects, I wield the power of the Spring framework, although occasionally, I venture into less conventional territories such as AI or data analysis. (Yes, my heart belongs to Java, but I hold a deep respect for Python's prowess in data manipulation, even though it's not my cup of tea.)

### VBA
<div align="center">
I won't shy away from boasting about my mastery in this realm. I'm like a deity when it comes to VBA. However, my current endeavors primarily revolve around tweaking and enhancing previously developed projects, rather than embarking on new creations. There's little sense in concocting fresh VBA projects when Java offers a more robust solution, or when a simple script in shell can swiftly deliver the desired outcome.

### Rust
<div align="center">
Although relatively new to me, Rust has already proven its worth with its productivity-enhancing capabilities and level easier than other of low-level langs to learns. I'm eager to embrace the challenges it presents and anticipate that it will evoke the same level of excitement as I navigate through each new endeavor.

## Creative Pursuits
<div align="center">
‚ö° As a teenager, I dedicated countless hours to perfecting my craft in the realm of moviemaking, pouring my heart and soul into each project, striving relentlessly for excellence. Even today, I continue to embrace such tasks with unwavering passion, channeling every ounce of my energy into transforming them into true works of art. Each endeavor entrusted to me is met with a solemn vow to deliver nothing short of brilliance.
</div>
<div align="center">
Oh, and let's not overlook the radiant beacon of my existence‚Äîmusic crafting. While it may currently reside in the shadows cast by the dazzling allure of digital innovations, its significance in my life remains steadfast and resolute.
</div>


***If you've journeyed this far alongside me, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for your patience.***  
*But üòÑ I think you just bored.*

<div align="center"><h3>Farewell, adieu, or perhaps even üòÆ FireWall‚Äîuntil our paths cross once more!</h3><div align="center">
